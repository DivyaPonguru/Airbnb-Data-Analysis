# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
A data analysis project focused on analyzing Airbnb listings data to extract valuable insights.

Using a dataset containing details such as the neighborhood, price per night, and the number of reviews, this analysis aims to provide a clear understanding of the key factors influencing Airbnb listings.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers to ensure the integrity of the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various statistical and visual techniques were used to explore and understand the relationships between different features, such as price vs. the number of reviews, and average price per neighborhood.

Data Visualization: Data visualizations, including bar plots and scatter plots, were created to present key insights. Visuals were designed to be clear, intuitive, and easy to interpret for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Web App Integration: The data analysis is integrated into a simple Flask web app to provide an interactive experience. Users can view the raw dataset, visualizations, and other relevant statistics in a user-friendly format.

Technologies Used:

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Flask: For deploying the project as a web app.
Jinja2: For rendering dynamic content in the web app.

This project is a great demonstration of my ability to work with large datasets, perform data analysis, and build simple web applications to share insights interactively.

Goals:
Provide clear and actionable insights into Airbnb pricing trends.
Understand the relationship between the number of reviews and pricing across different neighborhoods.
Present data insights through an accessible web interface to allow users to explore the findings interactively.
